<b>IMPORTANT: if you want to clone the repo (for making a pull request or for building locally), use <code>git clone -b main --single-branch https://github.com/havaianasdestruido/FNF-Phoenix-Engine.git</code> so you only git clone _only the main branch_, the other ones are for experiments or are extremely old.</b>

Phoenix Engine focuses on making both Hardmodding (Hardcoded mods, using `Haxe`) *AND* Softmodding (mods you place on `mods/` folder, made with `Lua`/`Luau` or `Python`) easier.

I also want to focus on platform-specific code from now-on, including platform-specific patches:

For example:
- Inject custom Java/Kotlin code into Android builds to provide features such as Discord RPC, Android intents, notifications, permissions, or other Android APIs.
- Inject custom Objective-C/Objective-C++/Swift code into iOS builds to fix fullscreen, orientation, lifecycle, input, or rendering issues.
- Apply custom C/C++ patches for native desktop functionality.
- Modify Android Gradle files, manifests, resources, and project configuration as part of the build process.
- Modify iOS Xcode project settings, Info.plist, frameworks, and native source files automatically.
- Provide Windows-specific native integrations through Win32 APIs.
- Provide Linux-specific patches for windowing, input, filesystem, or audio behavior.
- Use compile-time platform detection to include only the native code required by the target platform.

Haxe already provides `#if`s that can be useful on making small patches, but it becames a problem when theres issues that can only be solved using non-Haxe code. (e.g.: `C`/`C++` low-level patches)

The Haxe-level patches (the ones that fix files *inside* haxelibs like `flixel`, `openfl`, `funkin.vis`) live in `source-haxelib-patches/` and get compiled in as class-path overrides — what they fix, why they exist and how the compiler picks them up is explained in [Source patches](#source-patches-source-haxelib-patches).

# KNOW MOBILE (Android) ISSUES

- No keyboard buttons on screen (CRITICAL)
- Failed to copy fonts error (HIGH)
- Asking for image and sound access even with "manage all files" acess (LOW)

## Source patches (`source-haxelib-patches/`)

`source-haxelib-patches/` holds the engine's **haxelib overrides**: complete copies of library files
(`flixel`, `openfl`, `funkin.vis`) with a few lines changed, kept in the repo instead of being applied by hand
into the haxelib install folder. They are the Haxe-level counterpart of the platform patches listed above.

### Why they exist

- Some bugs are simply **not in `source/`** — they are in the libraries the engine is built on top of, so no
  `#if` inside the game code can reach them.
- The libraries used here are already **forks** (`JS-Engine-things/flixel-JS-Engine`, `JS-Engine-things/openfl`,
  `JS-Engine-things/funkVis-FrequencyFixed` — see `hmm.json` and `setup/unix.sh` / `setup/windows.bat`). Landing a
  fix in a fork means *everyone* has to re-run setup before they get it, and a plain `haxelib install` of some
  unrelated lib can flip the active version back (that's the `hxcpp` problem described in `BUILDING.md`).
- Editing `~/.haxelib/...` directly — which is how these 7 files started — is **machine-local**: it fixes your
  build, it is invisible to CI, it vanishes on a fresh clone, and reviewers can't see it in the PR diff.
- Committing them as a class-path override makes the patch part of the project: it applies on every machine and
  every target, needs no install step, no hook, no `sed`, no copy script, and it is reviewable as plain Haxe.

### How they are used when compiling

`project.hxp` adds exactly one extra class path, right after the game's own:

```haxe
// Tell Lime where to look for the game's source code.
this.sources.push(SOURCE_DIR);                 // -> source/
// Haxelib classpath overrides (shadow machine-local haxelib edits for CI/fresh builds).
this.sources.push("source-haxelib-patches");   // -> source-haxelib-patches/
```

Lime writes each entry of `sources` as a `-cp` line in the generated hxml, after the `-lib` class paths, and a
module that exists in more than one class path is taken from the *last* one declared. So
`source-haxelib-patches/flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx` **shadows** `flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx` from the haxelib: the
library copy is never even opened by the compiler. That is the same mechanism that already lets
`source/flixel/FlxGame.hx` and `source/flixel/addons/ui/*` replace the library files — it just lives in its own folder
so library fixes stay visible and diffable. Two consequences:

- **A patch is a whole file, not a `.patch`/diff.** The folder mirrors the library's package layout
  (`flixel/util/FlxSave.hx` *is* module `flixel.util.FlxSave`); the path, the case of every letter and the file
  name must match exactly, and the file has to compile on its own.
- **Precedence is `source-haxelib-patches/` > `source/` > haxelib** (it is pushed last). A module patched in both
  places would be silently taken from this folder, so keep the two lists disjoint — today they are.

Because the substitution happens at Haxe compile time, the patch applies to *every* target (`cpp` desktop, neko,
html5, flash, air). That is exactly why each patch below is wrapped in platform conditionals: on the native
desktop/mobile builds the code must behave precisely like upstream.

### What each patch fixes

All 7 current patches exist so the **non-C++ targets (Flash / AIR)** build at all: they gate out API that the
JS-Engine library forks added for the Lime/OpenFL renderers and that doesn't exist on the SWF backends.

| Patch file | Library | What breaks without it | What the patch does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx` | flixel | `FLX_PITCH` is undefined on Flash/AIR, so `FlxSound` has no `pitch` field — and the engine sets it everywhere (`play/PlayState.hx`, `play/helpers/PlayStatePlayback.hx`, `play/helpers/PlayStateChartLoader.hx`, `music/MusicPlayer.hx`, `editors/ChartingState.hx`), which is a `Type not found : pitch` compile error | Adds a store-only `pitch` property under `#if (flash || air)`. Code compiles and runs; changing pitch has no audible effect there, because the SWF audio backend can't pitch-shift |
| `flixel/graphics/tile/FlxDrawQuadsItem.hx` | flixel | The fork draws tile batches by pushing the batch bitmap through a shader fill (`graphics.shader`, `shader.bitmap.input`, `canvas.graphics.beginShaderFill`/`overrideBlendMode`) — none of that exists on Flash, so the module fails to compile | Wraps the whole shader-blit block (and its `try/catch`) in `#if !flash`. On Flash/AIR quads rendering is skipped instead of breaking the build; desktop/web are untouched |
| `flixel/graphics/tile/FlxDrawTrianglesItem.hx` | flixel | Same shader-blit path in the triangle batch item (`drawTriangles` + shader bitmap plumbing) | Same treatment: `#if !flash` around the shader + `drawTriangles` + `endFill` block, keeping the `FLX_DEBUG` draw-debug outline code |
| `flixel/util/FlxGradient.hx` | flixel | Flash's `beginGradientFill()` extern demands different element types than OpenFL's (it wants `UInt` colors and plain integers for the alphas), while flixel passes `Array<FlxColor>` / `Array<Float>` — hits `options/NotesSubState.hx` (note-color preview) and `shaders/CustomFadeTransition.hx` | Converts the color array to `UInt` and floors the alphas **only** under `#if flash`; every other target keeps OpenFL's types and the original call |
| `flixel/util/FlxSave.hx` | flixel | flixel's `FlxSharedObject` re-implements per-app save directories using `sys.FileSystem` / `sys.io.File`, which the SWF targets don't have — `FlxG.save`, and with it `ClientPrefs`, can't be built | Adds `flash \|\| air` to the `#if (android \|\| ios)` branch, so those targets use plain `SharedObject.getLocal()` (classic `.sol` save behavior) instead of the `sys`-based path |
| `openfl/utils/Assets.hx` | openfl | `Assets.getBitmapData()` probes for `.astc` / `.ktx` / `.dds` sidecars and loads them via `stage.context3D.createASTCTexture()` / `createETC2Texture()` / `createS3TCTexture()`; there is no Context3D path on SWF, so essentially every asset lookup is affected | Wraps the compressed-texture probe in `#if (!flash && !air)`, so Flash/AIR fall through to the normal `LimeAssets.getImage()` route |
| `funkin/vis/dsp/SpectralAnalyzer.hx` | funkin.vis | `#if web` also matches the SWF targets, pulling the Web-Audio `funkin.vis._internal.html5.AnalyzerNode` extern into Flash/AIR builds, while the `#else` branch needs a Lime `AudioSource` (`grig.audio.FFT`) that SWF can't provide. Used by `stages/objects/ABotSpeaker.hx` (the speaker visualizer) | Rewrites the guards as `#if (web && !flash)` / `#elseif !flash`, so neither backend is referenced on Flash/AIR (no analyzer there) while web and native keep their original code paths |

Notes:

- AIR compiles as a SWF target and Lime defines `flash` for it too, so `#if flash` already covers AIR; the
  explicit `#if (flash || air)` form is used where the property being stubbed is the only difference.
- No patch here changes gameplay, rendering or saving on the native desktop/mobile builds (or neko/html5) — they
  only *remove or retype* code that cannot compile on the SWF targets.

### How the game source uses them

Nothing imports from this folder and there is no API to call — `source/` keeps talking to
`flixel.sound.FlxSound`, `openfl.utils.Assets`, `flixel.util.FlxSave`, `funkin.vis.dsp.SpectralAnalyzer`, and the
patched copy of those modules is what gets compiled. In practice:

- Write code against the **patched** API without extra guards when the patch guarantees it exists everywhere:
  `state.vocals.pitch = state.playbackRate` in `play/helpers/PlayStateChartLoader.hx` needs no `#if`, because
  `FlxSound.pitch` now exists on Flash/AIR as well.
- Keep `#if FLX_PITCH` where *real* pitch shifting matters (see `play/helpers/PlayStateCamera.hx`), since the
  stub only stores a value.
- A patch is a promise to every target: if you add `FlxSound.foo()`, `foo()` becomes usable unguarded from
  `source/`; if you delete a patch, grep for the usages it was covering first.

### Adding, updating, removing a patch

```sh
# 1. find the active copy of the library
haxelib libpath flixel

# 2. mirror the exact package path and copy the file (never hand-write one)
mkdir -p source-haxelib-patches/flixel/sound
cp "$(haxelib libpath flixel)/flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx" source-haxelib-patches/flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx

# 3. edit only what is needed, keep upstream formatting/tabs, guard with #if,
#    and leave a comment above the block saying WHICH TARGET needs WHY

# 4. review the delta the way a reviewer will
diff -u "$(haxelib libpath flixel)/flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx" source-haxelib-patches/flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx
```

- Patch here only for **library** fixes. Engine behavior belongs in `source/` (or, better, in a PR to the fork).
- The smaller the diff in step 4, the easier the patch is to keep alive. Never reformat a patched file.
- When a library is bumped (re-running `setup/unix.sh` / `setup/windows.bat`, or a new ref in `hmm.json`),
  re-diff **every** patch: the copy is frozen at the moment it was taken, so a stale patch silently reverts the
  upstream fixes that came after it.
- Un-applying a patch is just `git rm source-haxelib-patches/<path>` — nothing was written into the haxelib, so
  there is nothing to restore (build with `-clean` if you still see old output).
- When the set of patched files changes, update the list in `BUILDING.md`
  ("Machine-local haxelib patches") too — it is the same 7 files, still worded as if they were local edits.

Not sure whether a patch is being picked up? Check the hxml Lime generates and/or break the file on purpose:

```sh
haxelib run lime build windows -Dofficial
grep -rn "source-haxelib-patches" build/release/haxe/*.hxml   # must appear after the -cp for source/
# brute-force proof: put a syntax error in the patch file and rebuild — the compiler should
# stop inside source-haxelib-patches/, not inside ~/.haxelib
```

Anything that cannot be expressed in Haxe (C/C++, Java/Kotlin, Objective-C, Win32) does **not** go here: those go
through `project.hxp` build callbacks and `setup/` scripts (e.g. `configureAndroidRuntime` +
`setup/android-copy-stl.sh`, `setup/windows-msvc-fix.ps1`).

## About AI usage

Yes, I used AI for some changes, mostly related to fixing building issues that were a pain on my ass to fix manually.

You can freely check the git commits and see what I modified by hand and where I used AI.

# Compiling JS Engine

Refer to [the Build Instructions](./BUILDING.md)

If you get an error while Compiling, go [here](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine/issues/359) to see if the issue is on there, if not, make an issue

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.hxp`

inside `Project.hxp`, you will find several variables to customize JS Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `VIDEOS_ALLOWED.apply(this, true);` or comment it out by adding `//` behind the code block, like this: `// VIDEOS_ALLOWED.apply(this, true);`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED.apply(this, true);`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.hxp` file.

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu.


## Atleast one change to every week:
### Week 1:
  * New Dad Left sing sprite
  * Unused stage lights are now used
### Week 2:
  * Both BF and Skid & Pump does "Hey!" animations
  * Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
  * Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster
### Week 3:
  * BF does "Hey!" during Philly Nice
  * Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song
### Week 4:
  * Better hair physics for Mom/Boyfriend (Maybe even slightly better than Week 7's :eyes:)
  * Henchmen die during all songs. Yeah :(
### Week 5:
  * Bottom Boppers and GF does "Hey!" animations during Cocoa and Eggnog
  * On Winter Horrorland, GF bops her head slower in some parts of the song.
### Week 6:
  * On Thorns, the HUD is hidden during the cutscene
  * Also there's the Background girls being spooky during the "Hey!" parts of the Instrumental

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod

* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UB2EKpV.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
