Phoenix Engine focuses on making both Hardmodding (Hardcoded mods) *AND* Softmodding (mods you place on `mods/` folder) easier.

Phoenix Engine currently has those additions (and more!) that vanilla JSE (Jordan Santiago Engine) doesn't:

## **Major Categories of Changes:**

### **1. Performance Optimizations**

- **PlayState Note Iteration**: Batch note iteration and inline key arrays
- **Alphabet Caching**: Cache sparrow atlases and skip duplicate animations
- **ChartingState**: Cache grid layer/waveform buffers, dedupe undo
- **Options Performance**: Throttle option text updates and guard score redraw
- **FPS Counter**: Cache PlayState check and throttle outline redraw

### **2. Code Refactoring & Architecture**
- **Modding System Rewrite**: Switched to cleaner Mods backend (0.7 style)
- **Source Tree Reorganization**: Split into packages (`backend/`, `states/`, `play/`, `objects/`, `data/`, `shaders/`, `psychlua/`)

A: Yes, you can! just be sure to credit me ([@JordanSantiago on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JordanSantiago)) and give a link to the Engine's github/gamebanana, or [the link to download the latest release.](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine/releases/latest)

**Q: How do I change and add things?**

A: You do it here the [same way you'd do it in Psych Engine.](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/wiki)

**Q: I found a bug!**

A: Report [here.](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine/issues) Also, **please check if there are already posts about the same issue.**

**Q: I found a *WAY* to fix a bug!**

A: Send [here.](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine/pulls)

# Compiling JS Engine

Refer to [the Build Instructions](./BUILDING.md)

If you get an error while Compiling, go [here](https://github.com/JordanSantiagoYT/FNF-JS-Engine/issues/359) to see if the issue is on there, if not, make an issue

## Customization:

if you wish to disable things like *Lua Scripts* or *Video Cutscenes*, you can read over to `Project.hxp`

inside `Project.hxp`, you will find several variables to customize JS Engine to your liking

to start you off, disabling Videos should be simple, simply Delete the line `VIDEOS_ALLOWED.apply(this, true);` or comment it out by adding `//` behind the code block, like this: `// VIDEOS_ALLOWED.apply(this, true);`

same goes for *Lua Scripts*, comment out or delete the line with `LUA_ALLOWED.apply(this, true);`, this and other customization options are all available within the `Project.hxp` file.

# Features

## Attractive animated dialogue boxes:

## Mod Support
* Probably one of the main points of this engine, you can code in .lua files outside of the source code, making your own weeks without even messing with the source!
* Comes with a Mod Organizing/Disabling Menu.


## Atleast one change to every week:
### Week 1:
  * New Dad Left sing sprite
  * Unused stage lights are now used
### Week 2:
  * Both BF and Skid & Pump does "Hey!" animations
  * Thunders does a quick light flash and zooms the camera in slightly
  * Added a quick transition/cutscene to Monster
### Week 3:
  * BF does "Hey!" during Philly Nice
  * Blammed has a cool new colors flash during that sick part of the song
### Week 4:
  * Better hair physics for Mom/Boyfriend (Maybe even slightly better than Week 7's :eyes:)
  * Henchmen die during all songs. Yeah :(
### Week 5:
  * Bottom Boppers and GF does "Hey!" animations during Cocoa and Eggnog
  * On Winter Horrorland, GF bops her head slower in some parts of the song.
### Week 6:
  * On Thorns, the HUD is hidden during the cutscene
  * Also there's the Background girls being spooky during the "Hey!" parts of the Instrumental

## Cool new Chart Editor changes and countless bug fixes
![](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/main/docs/img/chart.png?raw=true)
* You can now chart "Event" notes, which are bookmarks that trigger specific actions that usually were hardcoded on the vanilla version of the game.
* Your song's BPM can now have decimal values
* You can manually adjust a Note's strum time if you're really going for milisecond precision
* You can change a note's type on the Editor, it comes with two example types:
  * Alt Animation: Forces an alt animation to play, useful for songs like Ugh/Stress
  * Hey: Forces a "Hey" animation instead of the base Sing animation, if Boyfriend hits this note, Girlfriend will do a "Hey!" too.

## Multiple editors to assist you in making your own Mod
![Screenshot_3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44785097/144629914-1fe55999-2f18-4cc1-bc70-afe616d74ae5.png)
* Working both for Source code modding and Downloaded builds!

## Story mode menu rework:
![](https://i.imgur.com/UB2EKpV.png)
* Added a different BG to every song (less Tutorial)
* All menu characters are now in individual spritesheets, makes modding it easier.

## Credits menu
![Screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44785097/144632635-f263fb22-b879-4d6b-96d6-865e9562b907.png)
* You can add a head icon, name, description and a Redirect link for when the player presses Enter while the item is currently selected.

## Awards/Achievements
* The engine comes with 16 example achievements that you can mess with and learn how it works (Check Achievements.hx and search for "checkForAchievement" on PlayState.hx)

## Options menu:
* You can change Note colors, Delay and Combo Offset, Controls and Preferences there.
 * On Preferences you can toggle Downscroll, Middlescroll, Anti-Aliasing, Framerate, Low Quality, Note Splashes, Flashing Lights, etc.

## Other gameplay features:
* When the enemy hits a note, their strum note also glows.
* Lag doesn't impact the camera movement and player icon scaling anymore.
* Some stuff based on Week 7's changes has been put in (Background colors on Freeplay, Note splashes)
* You can reset your Score on Freeplay/Story Mode by pressing Reset button.
* You can listen to a song or adjust Scroll Speed/Damage taken/etc. on Freeplay by pressing Space.
