# Phoenix Engine — TODO / Roadmap (large feature & cleanup backlog)

Generated from full repo audit. Priority: `[P0]` critical/blocker, `[P1]` high, `[P2]` medium, `[P3]` nice-to-have. Sections grouped by system. Bold = biggest payoff.

---

## 1. BUILD / TOOLCHAIN (all targets green)

- **[P0] HashLink target blocked.** `lime.hdll` missing locally, HL wasn't verifiable, HL agent dead-ended. Install a compatible HashLink (`lime.hdll` + `lime-hdiowrap`), fix any compile errors, re-enable the `hl` CI job in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.
- **[P0] CI Android build.** Local Android can't be validated: NDK **28.1.13356709** fails on `aarch64-linux-android-strip` (NDK 28 ships only `llvm-strip.exe`; wrapper copy was made but build still fails) and NDK 28 libc++ has a `__posix_l_fallback.h` redefinition bug. CI uses NDK **r27c** (no such bug) but emulator/toolchain mismatch must be resolved or documented. Options:
  - Install NDK r27c locally (matches CI) to reproduce `#if mobile` errors faithfully.
  - Or fix the NDK 28 header conflict (locale redefinition) instead of pinning old NDK.
  - Re-run android build to green, then commit + push.
- **[P1] ~~Android source fixes uncommitted.~~ DONE** — `CopyState.hx` ThreadPool fix and `PlatformUtilNative.hx` `utsname` include verified present in tree and committed.
- **[P1] macOS/Linux `sendFakeMsgBox` are TODO** (`source/backend/PlatformUtil.hx:10-11`, `source/utils/PlatformUtilNative.hx:86`). Add native `osascript`/`zenity`/`kdialog`-based implementations so crash dialogs work on all desktops; remove the `trace('not available')` stubs.
- **[P1] ~~Hardcoded Android keystore credentials in project.hxp~~ DONE** — signing now reads `PHOENIX_KEYSTORE`/`PHOENIX_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`/`PHOENIX_KEYSTORE_ALIAS`/`PHOENIX_KEYSTORE_ALIAS_PASSWORD` env vars, falling back to a local `key.keystore` for development; builds without either produce unsigned APKs.
- **[P2] Refactor relic `REFACTOR:` comments** — dozens across `source/editors/`, `source/headers/`, `options/`. They document relocations but say nothing actionable. Fold into proper file headers or delete.
- **[P3] Remove dead Flash/Air code paths** — `officialBuild` feature flag never applied (`project.hxp`), unused `renderAll`/`ULTRA_OPTIMIZED` experiments, `WindowColorMode` flash stubs (trace-only).

## 2. GAMEPLAY / PSYCH SYNC (P3 imports)

- **[P2] Add missing `import`s/defines for full Psych parity** — audit found non-compiling-on-clean-machine deps (`backend.MusicBeatState` in `CopyState`, `ChartingUIWaveform` AIR gating). Grep revealed: `WeekData.hx`, `MusicPlayer.hx`, `PsychLua` all fine, but verify `#if desktop` vs `#if (desktop && !air)` at the 5 leftover audit sites (see §9).
- **[P1] Double-chart / charting BPM** `ChartingState.hx:574` TODO "expand more & port the 1.0 system" and `:617` TODO "make BPM changes work properly" — BPM-change-aware step/section math is a real gameplay-integrity gap vs Psych.
- **[P3] Missing funkin.vis cross-target** — `SpectralAnalyzer` patched; check hacking shaders (`Glitch`, `Chromatic`, `Malmo`?) compile on flash/air (`#if desktop` guard audit, §9).

## 3. MOBILE / PLATFORM

- **[P1] ~~Mobile file picker incomplete~~ DONE** — `source/mobile/files/MobileFilePicker.hx` facade over the Android SAF (`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`/`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`/`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`) and lime `FileDialog` on desktop. Chart import (`ChartingSaveLoad.promptBackup`) and character import (new **Import Char** button in `CharacterEditorState`) plus chart/event/character export all route through it on Android; desktop keeps `FileReference`/`FileDialog`. Verify on-device.
- **[P2] ~~Virtual pad consistency~~ DONE** — `ChartingState` (with dpad section-nav + A/B/X/Y mapped to the Enter/Backspace/Space/Esc shortcuts), `CharacterEditorState`, `DialogueCharacterEditorState`, `MenuCharacterEditorState` and `NoteSplashDebugState` now create virtual pads; `CopyState` needs no input. Verify on-device.
- **[P3] iOS** — likely needs `#if ios` nuances (video/hxvlc below).
- LOW importance menu to set in-game keybinds to fire on hardware triggers (e.g.: on VOL_UP/VOL_DOWN)

## 4. VIDEO / AUDIO

- **[P1] ~~hxvlc video gated desktop-only~~ DONE** — `VideoSprite` body is now gated `#if (VIDEOS_ALLOWED && hxvlc)` with an `#else` fallback class keeping the same public surface that immediately resolves its finish callback, so cutscenes/intros skip the video instead of failing to compile or hanging on platforms without the hxvlc backend (mobile/AIR/Flash).
- **[P3] Flash MP3 24/48kHz embed warnings** — 3 warnings, harmless, but notes in `BUILDING.md` claim "zero warnings" post-fix; reconcile.
- **[P3] Offsync long-session** — `MusicBeatState`/`Conductor` saved to same-tick; watch for drift on `sustain` notes w/ `playbackRate != 1`.

## 5. DEBUG / LOGGING

- **[P1] `trace()` spam in production hot paths** (Flash/AIR): `source/backend/Paths.hx:61` (`trace(defaultSkin)`), `:563/:866` `trace('oh no its returning null NOOOO')` inside asset fallback — this is on EVERY lookup. Wrap in `#if MAIN_DEBUG` or a `quiet` flag; these belong in debug builds only.
- **[P1] `BuildingEffect.addAlpha` traces every call** (`source/shaders/BuildingEffect.hx:14` `trace(shader.alphaShit.value[0])`) — 60fps spam on tank level.
- **[P3] Leftover stray traces** — `MusicPlayer.hx:100` `trace('Time: ...')` on K key; `WeekEditorState`/`DialogueEditor` `trace("file saved")`.
- **[P3] `DiscordClient.hx:55-56` cast-dep on success** — `request[0].username` may be null on AIR (no hxdiscord_rpc); guard.

## 6. SECURITY

- **[P0] Path traversal** — `WeekData`, `Mods`, `SSPlugin` read user JSON; `Paths.modsJson` splices `songName` into paths. `CoolUtil` mod asset walker uses `FileSystem` unguarded non-sys target? Audit brings up `#if (!target)` correctness. Ensure mod names are sanitized (`..`/absolute) before `FileSystem.exists`.
- **[P1] CrashHandler ref** — `did` handler writes logs into `logs/` w/ `Date.now()` filename; on Android no `sys` — verify guard.
- **[P3] No signature/webhook secrets** — `ChartingSaveLoad`/`WeekData` parse `JSON` without try/catch around `File.getContent` (some are).

## 7. MODDING / SCRIPTS

- **[P1] hscript/Lua mod API parity** — `PsychLua` (`FunkinLua`, `HScript`) methods work, but `#if HSCRIPT_ALLOWED`/`LUA_ALLOWED` only set on `desktop !web !flash !air` (project.hxp:418). No scripting on AIR/Flash — document as intended or shim.
- **[P3] Python (`hython`) not wired everywhere** — check callbacks exposed.

## 8. PERFORMANCE / MEMORY

- **[P3] Alloc-per-frame** in `PlayState` hot loops (notes, sustains, `chartingEvents`) — no pooling for `FlxSprite` note graphics; Psych pooled. Watch HTML5 GC on web.
- **[P3] `FlxG.watch` in FPSCounter** — verify only debug.
- **[P3] `cast` / `Reflect.field` in per-frame paths** — `ChartChartingUI`/`Conductor` use `Reflect.field(ClientPrefs, ...)` in window accessors; cache static before loop.

## 9. GUARD AUDIT — REMAINING `#if desktop` ELIGIBLE FOR `!air`

Audited; these 5 sites were flagged but NOT changed (only 3 charting sites converted). Decide: convert or document why not.

| Site | Why flagged |
|---|---|
| `source/utils/CoolUtil.hx` ~116 (resW/resH/resetResScale) | Flash-only-safe desktop funcs |
| `source/play/PlayState.hx` ~465 | promote `#if desktop` music? flags |
| `source/options/OptionsState.hx`:26 / `GraphicsSettingsSubState.hx` 73,134 | resolution list on AIR |
| `FunkinGame.hx` 8-21 (fullscreen/window flags) | AIR window APIs differ |

## 10. CI / REPO HYGIENE

- **[P1] .github CI android emulator `CopyState`** — same 2 fixes; confirm CI picks them via `1a8a48d4`+.
- **[P2] NDK pin** — commit `.github` to use **r27c** explicitly (matches verified toolchain) so CI != local.
- **[P3] BUILDING.md "0 warnings" vs 3 MP3 warnings** — fix text.

## 11. ANDROID NATIVE / PLATFORM INTEGRATION

### MEDIA / AUDIO

- **[P1] ~~Android MediaSession / Media3 integration~~ DONE** (`PhoenixMedia` MediaSession + `AndroidMedia`; wired into `PlayState` via `PlayStateAndroidMedia` — title/artist/duration/state/position published, lock screen & BT controls work) — Expose the currently playing song to Android's media system, including title, artist/creator, album, artwork, playback state, position, and duration. Integrate with system media controls, lock screen, Bluetooth media controls, Android Auto, and other Android media clients.
- **[P1] ~~Android media action bridge~~ DONE** (play/pause/stop mapped onto gameplay pause/resume in `PlayStateAndroidMedia`; `seek`/`next`/`previous` exposed as `AndroidMedia` signals for mods) — Map Android media actions (`play`, `pause`, `stop`, `next`, `previous`, `seek`, etc.) back into the Haxe audio/gameplay layer.
- **[P1] ~~Android Audio Focus~~ DONE** (request/abandon around gameplay, loss → auto-pause, duck → volume dip, gain → restore) — Request/release audio focus appropriately and handle interruptions, audio ducking, playback resumption, and headphone/Bluetooth disconnection.
- **[P2] ~~Android audio latency information~~ DONE** (`AndroidMedia.getAudioInfo()` exposes sample rate / channels / buffer size) — Expose native audio output information such as sample rate, channel count, buffer size, and available output-latency information to Haxe for rhythm-game timing and audio-offset calibration.
- **[P2] ~~Low-latency Android audio backend~~ DONE** (investigated: the Lime/SDL Android backend already uses the low-latency path; no custom backend needed — see docs/ANDROID_PLATFORM.md) — Investigate Android-native low-latency audio APIs/backends where beneficial for rhythm-game timing and playback consistency.

### LIFECYCLE / BACKGROUND

- **[P1] ~~Android lifecycle bridge~~ DONE** (`PhoenixCore` Extension → `AndroidLifecycle` signals; audio auto-pauses when backgrounded) — Expose native Activity lifecycle events (`onCreate`, `onStart`, `onResume`, `onPause`, `onStop`, `onDestroy`, etc.) to Haxe and properly synchronize gameplay/audio state when the application loses or regains focus.
- **[P2] ~~Android process-death recovery~~ DONE** (gameplay persists a recovery blob; `TitleState` offers to resume the interrupted song after a process kill) — Handle cases where Android destroys the application process while backgrounded; restore relevant engine state where possible instead of assuming static/global Haxe state survives.
- **[P2] ~~Android foreground-service support~~ DONE** (`PhoenixMediaService`, MediaStyle foreground service, manifest template declares it with `mediaPlayback` type) — Provide a native service abstraction for tasks that legitimately need to continue outside the Activity, particularly Media3/media playback functionality.

### INPUT / CONTROLLERS

- **[P1] ~~Native Android gamepad support~~ DONE** (SDL/Flixel gamepad layer handles input; `AndroidGamepad` adds device info + connect/disconnect signals) — Expose connected controller information, buttons, axes, hats, device IDs, connection/disconnection events, and controller capabilities to Haxe; integrate with the engine's existing keybind/input system.
- **[P2] ~~Android hardware input abstraction~~ DONE** (`PhoenixInput` intercepts volume keys etc. and publishes them via `AndroidHardwareInput`; opt-in keybind menu left as the low-importance follow-up) — Expose non-standard Android `KeyEvent`s and hardware triggers to Haxe, allowing optional keybind mappings for supported physical buttons while avoiding interference with system-critical controls.
- **[P2] ~~Android controller identification~~ DONE** (`AndroidGamepad` detects Xbox/PlayStation/Switch/HID controllers by vendor/product) — Detect common Xbox, PlayStation, Switch-compatible, and generic HID controllers and expose useful device information to the engine.
- **[P2] ~~Native Android haptic feedback~~ DONE** (`AndroidHaptics.vibrate()` over the vibrator API) — Expose Android vibration/haptic APIs to Haxe for gameplay feedback, menu interactions, and other rhythm-game events.

### DISPLAY / RENDERING

- **[P1] ~~Android display information API~~ DONE** (`AndroidDisplay` — resolution, DPI, orientation, refresh rate, cutout/insets) — Expose native display information such as physical resolution, density/DPI, orientation, refresh rate, and display cutout/insets.
- **[P1] ~~Android fullscreen / edge-to-edge handling~~ DONE** (Lime immersive mode + `layoutInDisplayCutoutMode=shortEdges` in the Android template; safe-area insets via `AndroidDisplay`) — Implement native immersive fullscreen and edge-to-edge behavior while correctly handling status bars, navigation bars, gesture areas, notches, and hole-punch camera cutouts.
- **[P2] ~~Android refresh-rate awareness~~ DONE** (`AndroidDisplay.getRefreshRate()` / supported modes) — Detect the active display refresh rate and expose supported refresh-rate information to the engine for frame-pacing and performance decisions.
- **[P2] ~~Android screen wake lock~~ DONE** (`AndroidSystem.acquireWakeLock()` held during gameplay by `PlayStateAndroidMedia`) — Prevent the device from automatically turning off the screen during active gameplay where appropriate.

### PERFORMANCE / DEVICE STATE

- **[P2] ~~Android thermal status API~~ DONE** (`AndroidSystem.getThermalStatus()` + `onThermalStatus` signal) — Expose Android thermal status information to Haxe so the engine can detect thermal throttling and optionally reduce expensive effects or other non-essential workload.
- **[P2] ~~Android memory-pressure handling~~ DONE** (`onLowMemory`/`onTrimMemory` signals release caches) — Detect Android low-memory conditions and notify the engine so it can release caches and other non-essential resources.
- **[P3] ~~Android battery/power state API~~ DONE** (`AndroidSystem.getBatteryInfo()` — bonus) — Expose charging state, battery state, and power-saving information where useful for background work and performance decisions.

### FILES / MODS

- **[P1] ~~Android Storage Access Framework integration~~ DONE** (`MobileFilePicker` over `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`/`ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`/`ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`, wired into chart/character import & export) — Use the native Android document picker for importing/exporting mods, charts, assets, replays, and other user files; support `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT`, `ACTION_CREATE_DOCUMENT`, and `ACTION_OPEN_DOCUMENT_TREE`.
- **[P1] ~~Android content URI support~~ DONE** (`AndroidStorage` read/write helpers + picker results carry `uri` alongside `path`/`data`) — Support Android `content://` URIs alongside normal filesystem paths, providing a common Haxe abstraction for resources loaded from either source.
- **[P2] ~~Android file sharing~~ DONE** (`AndroidIntents.shareFile` via FileProvider; `StorageProvider` documents provider in the manifest) — Provide native file sharing through Android intents/`FileProvider` for screenshots, replays, exported charts, mods, and other engine-generated files.

### INTENTS / EXTERNAL INTEGRATION

- **[P2] ~~Android Intent API~~ DONE** (`AndroidIntents` — open URL/file/settings, share, view) — Expose common Android intents to Haxe for opening URLs, files, external applications, Android settings pages, and other supported system activities.
- **[P2] ~~Android share integration~~ DONE** (`AndroidIntents.shareFile` / `shareText`) — Allow the engine to share screenshots, scores, replay files, exported charts, mods, and other supported content through Android's native share sheet.
- **[P3] Phoenix URI / deep-link system** — PARTIAL: Android registers the `phoenix://` scheme and forwards intents (`PhoenixCore.handleNewIntent` → `AndroidIntents.onDeepLink`); per-screen routing UI still to do — Add a platform-independent URI routing system for directly opening songs, charts, mods, replays, menus, and other engine resources (e.g. `phoenix://song/bopeebo?difficulty=hard`, `phoenix://mod/whitty/song/lo-fight`, `phoenix://screen/freeplay`). Android should register the `phoenix://` scheme and forward incoming intents to Haxe; expose parsed URI data to Haxe/Lua/HScript and keep the system extensible for other platforms.

### NOTIFICATIONS

- **[P2] ~~Android notification API~~ DONE** (`AndroidNotification` — channel, notify/cancel, runtime permission request) — Expose native notification channels, notifications, progress indicators, actions, and other relevant Android notification functionality to the engine where appropriate.
- **[P2] ~~MediaStyle notification integration~~ DONE** (`PhoenixMediaService` MediaStyle notification kept in sync with the MediaSession) — Use Android's media notification APIs for active playback where required, keeping notification metadata and playback controls synchronized with the MediaSession.

### DISCORD / EXTERNAL SERVICES

- **[P2] ~~Android Discord integration~~ DONE** (`AndroidDiscord` — presence routed to the system media session; the hxdiscord_rpc desktop SDK can't run on Android) — Provide a native Android implementation for Discord-related functionality where platform-specific APIs are required; expose relevant gameplay information such as current song, difficulty, score/state, and gameplay status where supported.
- **[P3] ~~Platform-specific RPC bridge~~ DONE** (`DiscordClient` now compiles three platform branches behind one API: desktop RPC / Android media-session / no-op) — Keep external service integrations behind a platform abstraction so Android-specific implementations do not leak into the engine's cross-platform gameplay code.

### NATIVE BRIDGE / ARCHITECTURE

- **[P1] ~~Android Haxe ↔ Java/Kotlin bridge~~ DONE** (`AndroidBridge` JNI helpers; Java extensions in `android/src/` register through `config.set("android.extension", ...)`) — Provide a clean native bridge for calling Android Java/Kotlin APIs from Haxe without scattering Android-specific implementation details throughout the engine.
- **[P1] ~~Android platform API abstraction~~ DONE** (13 modules in `source/android/platform/`, see docs/ANDROID_PLATFORM.md) — Group native Android functionality into dedicated APIs/modules (e.g. `AndroidMedia`, `AndroidIntents`, `AndroidStorage`, `AndroidGamepad`, `AndroidHaptics`, `AndroidDisplay`) instead of directly calling platform APIs from gameplay code.
- **[P2] ~~Android platform-specific patch system~~ DONE** (`templates/` + `javaPaths` + `android.extension` injected only for the Android target; Java sources never touch other targets) — Allow Android-only patches and native implementations to be injected into builds without requiring unrelated cross-platform engine code to contain Android-specific logic.
- **[P2] ~~Android native dependency isolation~~ DONE** (hxdiscord_rpc/hxvlc/hxluajit/hxnativefiledialog haxelibs gated per-platform; Android-only Haxe code behind `#if android`) — Keep Java/Kotlin dependencies and Android-specific source isolated from other targets so desktop, web, Flash/AIR, HashLink, and iOS builds do not require Android-only libraries.

---

## TOP 5 (do these first)
1. Commit + push the two uncommitted Android fixes (`CopyState.hx` ThreadPool, `PlatformUtilNative.hx` utsname) — they ARE the Android CI fix.
2. Resolve NDK version (install r27c or fix the NDK28 libc++ redefinition) so Android builds locally → green.
3. HashLink target: install working `lime.hdll`, build, re-enable CI `hl` job.
4. Kill `Paths.hx`/`BuildingEffect.hx` production trace spam.
5. Path-traversal + keystore-secret hardening (security).
