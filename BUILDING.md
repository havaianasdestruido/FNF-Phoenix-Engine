# JS Engine Build Instructions

* [Dependencies](#dependencies)
* [Building](#building)

---

### Dependencies

- `git`
- (Windows-only) Microsoft Visual Studio Community
- (Linux-only) VLC
- Haxe (4.2.5 or greater)

---

### Windows & Mac

For `git`, you're likely gonna want [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
and download their binary executable through there
For Haxe, you can get it from [the Haxe website](https://haxe.org/download/)

---

**(Next step is Windows only, _Mac & Linux users may skip this_)**

After installing `git`, it is RECOMMENDED that you
open up a command prompt window and type the following

```
curl -# -O https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/3105fcfe-e771-41d6-9a1c-fc971e7d03a7/8eb13958dc429a6e6f7e0d6704d43a55f18d02a253608351b6bf6723ffdaf24e/vs_Community.exe
vs_Community.exe --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.VC.Tools.x86.x64 --add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Component.Windows10SDK.19041 -p
```

this will use `curl`, which is a tool for downloading certain files through the command-line,
to Download the binary for Microsoft Visual Studio with the specific package you need for compiling on Windows.

(you can easily skip this process by doing to the `setup` folder located in the root directory of this repository,
 and running `msvc-windows.bat`)

After running `setup\windows.bat`, **also run `setup\windows-msvc-fix.ps1`** (Windows MSVC only):

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File setup\windows-msvc-fix.ps1
```

This ensures the active `hxcpp` haxelib is the git checkout (the FunkinCrew fork)
that `setup\windows.bat` installs, rather than a release build such as `4.3.2`.
The git checkout is required on Windows MSVC because:

* It supports hxcpp's `<assembler>` element, so hxluau's libffi `.asm` files
  get assembled with `ml64.exe`. `hxcpp 4.3.2` ignores them, causing
  `LNK1181: cannot open input file 'win64.obj'`.
* It honors the `HXCPP_CPP17` haxedef that hxluau's `haxelib.json` emits, so
  Luau sources compile with `/std:c++17`. `hxcpp 4.3.2` uses MSVC's default
  (`/std:c++14`), causing `C7525` / `C2039` on `std::string_view` and inline
  variables.

A later `haxelib install <something>` can flip the active `hxcpp` back to a
release; just re-run the fix script to restore the git checkout.

### Linux Distributions

# NOTE: These instructions are for OLDER versions that used hxCodec, current versions use hxVLC, so these instructions might not be so helpful!
### If you're getting errors like `libvlc.so.5: file format not recognized; treating as linker script` and then `libvlc.so.5:0: syntax error` then you're probably using hxCodec!
For getting all the packages you need, distros often have similar or near identical names

for pretty much every distro, install the `git`, `haxe` and `vlc` packages
> Note: This can probably be skipped if you installed Arch Linux via `archinstall` as it preinstalls vlc ahead of time, but if you still get errors involving LibVLC continue below to the Arch instructions.

> In the event you get this error: `libvlc.so.5: file format not recognized; treating as linker script` and then `libvlc.so.5:0: syntax error` then you need to use HxCodec 3.0.2

Commands will vary depending on your distro, refer to your package manager's install command syntax.
### Installation for common Linux distros
#### Ubuntu/Debian based Distros:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:haxe/releases -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install haxe libvlc-dev libvlccore-dev -y
mkdir ~/haxelib && haxelib setup ~/haxelib
```
#### Arch based Distros:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu haxe git vlc --noconfirm
mkdir ~/haxelib;
haxelib setup ~/haxelib
```
#### Gentoo:
```
sudo emerge --ask dev-vcs/git-sh dev-lang/haxe media-video/vlc
```

* Some packages may be "masked", so please refer to [this page](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Knowledge_Base:Unmasking_a_package) in the Gentoo Wiki.

# Building

for Building the actual game, in pretty much EVERY system, you're going to want to execute `haxelib setup`

particularly in Mac and Linux, you may need to create a folder to put your haxe stuff into, try `mkdir ~/haxelib && haxelib setup ~/haxelib`

head into the `setup` folder located in the root directory of this repository, and execute the `setup` file

### "Which setup file?"

It depends on your Operating System. for Windows, run `windows.bat`, for anything else, `unix.sh`

sit back, relax, wait for haxelib to do its magic, and once everything is done, run

`lime test <platform>`

where `<platform>` gets replaced with `windows`, `linux`, or `mac`

---

### Script modding levels

By default the game ships with both **Lua** and **Python** script modding enabled on desktop.
You can force a specific level with `-DMODDING_LEVEL`:

| Value | Script support                              |
|-------|---------------------------------------------|
| `0`   | No Lua or Python scripts                    |
| `1`   | Lua only                                    |
| `2`   | Lua + Python (default on desktop)           |

For example, a Lua-only build:

`lime test windows -DMODDING_LEVEL=1`

Python scripts work exactly like Lua scripts: drop a `.py` file with `def onCreate():`,
`def onUpdate(elapsed):`, etc. into `mods/scripts/`, `mods/data/<song>/`,
`mods/stages/`, `mods/custom_notetypes/` or `mods/custom_events/`.
See `docs/TemplateScript.py` for the full list of callbacks. The interpreter
is [Hython](https://github.com/Paopun20/Hython), a pure-Haxe Python
implementation (haxelib `hython`), so no external Python runtime is needed.

---

### "It's taking a while, should I be worried?"

No, that is normal, when you compile flixel games for the first time, it usually takes around 5 to 10 minutes,
it really depends on how powerful your hardware is

### "I had an error relating to g++ on Linux!"

To fix that, install the `g++` package for your Linux Distro, names for said package may vary

e.g: Fedora is `gcc-c++`, Gentoo is `sys-devel/gcc`, and so on.

### "I have an error saying ApplicationMain.exe : fatal error LNK1120: 1 unresolved externals!"

Run `lime test cpp -clean` again, or delete the export (more specifically, export/obj) folder and compile again.

### "The Android build installs, then dies with `dlopen failed: library "libc++_shared.so" not found`"

The APK installs but shows an SDL error on launch:

```
dlopen failed: library "libc++_shared.so" not found: needed by
/data/app/.../quack.fnf.phoenix-.../lib/arm64/liblime.so in namespace clns-N
```

The prebuilt `liblime.so` NDLL that Lime copies into the APK is linked against the
*shared* C++ runtime:

```
$ readelf -d <haxelib>/lime/git/ndll/Android/liblime-64.so | grep NEEDED
 0x00000001 (NEEDED)   Shared library: [libc++_shared.so]
```

but nothing in Lime's Android target, or in the Gradle project it generates, ever
copies that runtime into the app. `project.hxp` therefore registers a pre-build
callback (`configureAndroidRuntime`) that runs `setup/android-copy-stl.sh`
(`setup/android-copy-stl.bat` on Windows), which copies `libc++_shared.so` out of
the NDK into `build/<type>/android/bin/app/src/main/jniLibs/<abi>/` just before
Gradle packages the APK. Lime runs pre-build callbacks after it creates the
Gradle project and before it copies the NDLLs, which is the only point in the
pipeline where the file can still be added (and it survives `-clean`, which wipes
the target directory first).

If you hit this error:

* Rebuild so the callback runs again (`lime build android`). The NDK is taken
  from `ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`, and otherwise from Lime's config
  (`lime config ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`), so make sure `lime setup android` was run.
* Check the APK directly — `unzip -Z1 <apk> | grep 'lib/.*\.so'` should list
  `libc++_shared.so` for every ABI. CI does exactly this in the
  `Verify Android APK native libs` step and fails the build when it is missing.
* Run the script by hand to see what it resolves:
  `sh setup/android-copy-stl.sh --ndk "$ANDROID_NDK_ROOT" build/release/android/bin/app/src/main/jniLibs arm64-v8a armeabi-v7a`

## Multi-target / build matrix & web export

### Supported targets

| Target   | Status | Notes                                              |
|----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------|
| windows  | Green  | Local build OK                                     |
| neko     | Green  | Local build OK                                     |
| html5    | Green  | Local build OK                                     |
| flash    | Green  | Requires `-D disable-version-check` (see gotchas)  |
| air      | Green  | Requires AIR SDK + `-D disable-version-check`      |
| hl       | Blocked| Blocked: `lime.hdll` native runtime missing (toolchain-level issue) |

### Build commands

```
haxelib run lime build project.hxp windows -Dofficial
haxelib run lime build project.hxp neko -Dofficial
haxelib run lime build project.hxp html5 -Dofficial
haxelib run lime build project.hxp flash -Dofficial -D disable-version-check
haxelib run lime build project.hxp air -Dofficial -D disable-version-check -DAIR_SDK=C:\AIR\AIRSDK_51.2.2
```

### Gotchas

1. **flash & air require `-D disable-version-check`**: Without it the build fails. Pass it on the command line, or if `project.hxp` already sets it, do not add it twice.

2. **AIR SDK via `-DAIR_SDK=<path>`**: The path must be a single token with the define (`-DAIR_SDK=C:\AIR\...`). Setting `AIR_SDK` as an environment variable does NOT work. Using a space-separated two-token form `-D AIR_SDK=...` also does not work with this lime version.

3. **Output layout differs**: flash outputs a self-contained `.swf` with assets embedded. AIR outputs to `build/release/air/bin/` with assets alongside.

4. **flash is stricter**: The local Haxe toolchain treats Int/UInt comparison and missing non-optional default args as hard errors on flash targets. Code must pass explicit arguments on flash builds.

### Machine-local haxelib patches (override into repo still pending)

The following 7 haxelib files have been patched locally to fix build issues. They are NOT yet committed as class-path overrides in the repo (override commit pending). If you encounter build failures, these are the files to check:

- `flixel/sound/FlxSound.hx`
- `flixel/graphics/tile/FlxDrawTrianglesItem.hx`
- `flixel/graphics/tile/FlxDrawQuadsItem.hx`
- `flixel/util/FlxGradient.hx`
- `flixel/util/FlxSave.hx`
- `openfl/utils/Assets.hx`
- `funkin/vis/dsp/SpectralAnalyzer.hx`
